I am Valerie, medium, healer and spiritual coach and have been working in my practice since 2016. I have deepened and developed myself in various directions and have my own authentic working method. My passion lies in helping people who want to understand their twin flame journey or their spiritual process.

{{< figure src="/images/about.webp">}}

My approach? Honest, practical and tailored to your needs.

I am highly sensitive, have the necessary life experience and a great emphatic ability, together with my spiritual “gift” this makes me very happy and it gives me energy to do this “work” or rather to say life mission.

There is so much more between heaven and earth, I am sure of that.

However, none of us are omniscient. I will share with you what I receive, feel and what my conviction is in a down-to-earth manner.

Feel welcome!
