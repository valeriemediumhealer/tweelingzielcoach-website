___Wendy:___ _I ​​thought it was a very special and nice reading. For me it was quite emotional. I expected it to be quite general, but it was actually personal. She has a pleasant voice to listen to. Many things were also right. And I really needed to hear that I should listen to myself more and trust myself, let go... I'm doing quite well. In any case, I really thought it was a gift! Thank you Valerie! Kind regards, Wendy_

___Monique:___ _Yesterday I received a healing. At the moment of the healing I felt so much peace in my body. At the end I felt a tingling in my legs and feet. Later I got the report, but wow, so special!! Now that the blockages have been removed, I can work on myself and learn to close myself off from other people and allow more other things to come in. Thank you for this beautiful healing. Love Monique_

___Sarina:___ _Yesterday I had a wonderful regression therapy with Valerie. At first I was nervous, but thanks to Valerie's wonderful voice and guidance this quickly disappeared. I went into the regression with a question and I got more clarity on this. I am very relieved that I have now been able to let go of this part. It is so strange and wonderful to see what comes to mind without thinking about it. It was a wonderful experience and I would recommend it to you. See you soon! Sarina_
