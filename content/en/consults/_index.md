As an experienced twin flame coach, medium and healer I will help you through a unique combination of spiritual insights, energetic healing, regression/past life sessions and practical guidance to:

- Find clarity.
- Letting go of blockages.
- To regain your own power.
- Spiritual lessons and discovering your soul mission.
- Support and guidance in your spiritual awakening and learning to trust the universe.

## Coaching
On your path to spiritual growth you can encounter many triggers. The journey can be hard and lonely. I am there for you as a listening ear,  I can support and guide you both practically and from a spiritual point of view.

## Reading
Through the unique rainbow reading that you or I make (depending on whether you come to the practice or whether it is remotely) I give you insights about the part of your life that you are in. Where are you now and what can you still work on? See it as a mirror that is held up to you. A twin flame card reading gives you answers and insights about where you and your twin flame stand, what is still blocking you, what spirit has to tell you about this and what might happen in the near future.

## Healing
Once you have met your twin flame, all sorts of things happen in your system that affect your entire being. A healing that means passing on energy, will go where it is needed for you at that moment, that is determined by spirit. Healing can help you to get rid of blockages such as emotional triggers, help with emotional baggage and relieve sadness.

## Regression
During a regression you gain insights and healing about blockages and traumas that (re)surface in your twin flame journey.

## Past life session
You and your twin flame have shared multiple lives. If you would like to know how that works and what patterns and triggers are at play, a past life session can offer a solution so that you can see things in a better perspective through the insights by reliving it, so that you can handle it in the present moment. which will cause your spiritual growth.
