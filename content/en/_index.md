The path of spiritual growth, and especially that of twinflames, can be challenging. I offer you a place where you can share your experiences, break free from old patterns, heal and find your strength step by step. With my knowledge, compassion and intuitive guidance I help you to gain insights and embrace your true self. Together we will work on gaining a deeper connection with yourself and your spiritual path.

___Twin Flames:___ _A special soul connection where youâ€™ll meet your other half, a soul split into two parts._

Sometimes you meet someone in your life of whom you know and feel this is special, I know you. All earthly logic does not apply here. Maybe you are dealing with a big age difference, a different culture, a different country or you or "he" is already in a relationship.

It turns your whole life upside down and it usually comes with an intense attraction and a deep connection, felt deep within your soul.

For a short period it is fun, you feel familiar with each other, you have a euphoric feeling, almost unreal as if time does not exist. However, this quickly turns into confusion, because of the intensity it is usually the divine masculine (the one with the male energy) who flees and leaves the divine feminine (the female energy) defeated and "she" does not understand it. The runner chaser dynamic begins where the divine feminine starts chasing she cannot let go, it seems like an obsession. The divine masculine is in denial and tries to continue with his life or escapes into other things.

In this time of separation they will face their own emotional triggers. They continuously mirror each other and there is attraction and repulsion. It is a real rollercoaster that can last for years with the goal of spiritual growth. In some cases a reunion will take place.

**What is meant to be, will be**

This process is not all daisies and roses, on the contrary, it is a deep spiritual transformation that you are going through. The connection remains forever, even beyond physical death.
